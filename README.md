The goal of this assignment is to implement an AI agent that can write code and verify that the code works as expected.

Example of a task that the agent can solve:

Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers and returns the average of the numbers.
The agent should be able to solve the task by writing the function in a Python file and verifying that the function works as expected. Finally, the agent should output the Python code in a code block.
